- 👋 Hi, I’m Gustavo B. Cruz, a 31-year-old from Brazil, currently living in Switzerland.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning/working Data Analytics and Science, as well as other IT applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on projects on Kaggle to enhance my Python and Data Science skills. I'm also planning to sign up Coursera to get more courses in this field. Additionally, I’m learning German. Genau!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Data Analytics projects involving machine learning in Python or R. I can also contribute to SQL projects.
- 📫 You can reach me via my personal [mail](gboaventuracruz@gmail.com), or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gustavo-boaventura-cruz/) as well.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can solve a Rubik's cube in less than one minute (an achievement I’m proud of! 😄)
